# COVID19 Life Support
The problem catered in this project is that as we all know there is an ongoing virus outbreak generally referred as the COVID19 is spreading around the globe and there are so many patients that are the prey to this deadly virus and need medical assistance. The problem is that this virus is extremely deadly and if not treated on time can cause death of the patient. So, this program runs in a way that it uses an algorithm that classifies and prioritize the patients on the basis of how sooner a patient is to be treated. 

The implementation of multi-level feedback queue is displayed by a bar graph animation which clearly shows that patients in the highest priority queue that is, those that are placed at the top are treated first and those beneath them, as in kept in low priority queue are treated accordingly. The data structure is relevant in this regard because if there are certain COVID patients who need immediate attention or are in critical condition will be given priority over others. Patients in low priority queue can only be facilitated once patients in high priority queue have been treated.
